    Protocol Specification:

    Master - controls {halt/resume}req.  E.g. a Debug Module
    Slave - controls {halt/resume}ack.   E.g. a CPU

    * {halt/resume}req is kept high until {halt/resume}ack is received - deasserting it before ack is invalid.
    * {halt/resume}ack is high only for a single clock cycle - master polls for it.
    * {halt/resume}ack can only be asserted one cycle after the {halt/resume}req or later
    * {halt/resume}req must be deasserted in the next cycle after the respective ack was asserted.
    * no *req can be asserted when still waiting for *ack.
    * haltreq and resumereq cannot be assrted both in same cycle.
    * no timeouts are defined - every Xreq will eventually be acked
    * haltreq on halted hart *is valid* (resumereq on running hart as well), and must be eventually acked.
    * it's slave's responsibility to assure, that no spurious ack are asserted
      (e.g. when core halts for different reason than master's request)
